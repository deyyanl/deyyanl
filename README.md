### More about me
Student, founder, developer & electronics hobbyst. Primarily designing consumer electronics and printed circuit boards, also I'm developing back-end solutions in high-end frameworks and technologies. Besides all of that, I'm into aerospace. I developed OberonSAT A1 - CubeSat, a small form factor communication satellite that was planned to be launched into low Earth orbit at an altitude of 500-2000 kilometers. Last summer, my friend and I made model scale rocket, topping at 4 meters in height and weighing more than 200 kilograms without propellant. In October of 2020, I was invited to hold a presentation about my space passion and projects at Tech Hosted by Lanaco conference. In February of 2020, I found severe security flaws in mobile application Snapchat, after reporting I was awarded with the position of Cyber Security Analyst which I do as part of my free time.
